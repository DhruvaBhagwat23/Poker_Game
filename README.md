Personal Projects: Interactive Poker Game

Inspired by AP Computer Science A Blackjack Game Project. Cannot upload my Blackjack Project as it is connected to my school, but please feel free to contact me at dhruvab@berkeley.edu regarding motivation for these projects and programming paradigms. 

Implemented the core game logic, including user input, hand rankings, hand comparisons, game states and traversals, and player actions such as betting, checking, or raising. 

Designed a scoring betting system to keep track of the player chips and number of wins through multiple matches.

Harnessed both functional programming and object-oriented programming to cleanly split separate aspects of the game into separate parts while also maintaining consistency and conciseness in the code.
